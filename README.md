# Advent of Code 2024

Advent of Code is an annual event where daily programming challenges are released each day in December. The puzzles range from easy to hard, and participants can solve them in any programming language. It's a great way to practice coding skills, prepare for interviews, or just have fun solving problems.

> This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2024 puzzles. I will be using Python to solve the problems, and I will be sharing my code and explanations here. Feel free to use my solutions as a reference, but I encourage you to try solving the puzzles on your own first.
